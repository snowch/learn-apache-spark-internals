## Overview

This branch is my attempt to learn spark internals by looking at a very early version of the code, tag 'alpha-0.1'.  The reason for looking back is that the code base was very small and easy to understand then.  Now the code base is much larger and it is difficult knowing where to get started.

My intention is to get a deep understanding of the spark internals in tag 'alpha-0.1'.  After that I will then move to the next tag or branch that I can easily compile and run and figure out the differences between that version and this one.  I intend to repeat this process until I reach the 'master' branch.

I have ported the alpha-0.1 code to use a more recent version of scala so that it can be worked on with the Scala IDE.

## Pre-requisites

 - You have installed Scala IDE: http://scala-ide.org/
 - You have some experience of using spark via the spark APIs
 - You have at least a basic knowledge of scala and keen to learn more as you go
